- Fix heisenbug causing hang in middle of simulation
    - bug was previously appearing at least 1 per 10 runs, ran 30+ times without appearing,
      concluded initial proposed fix actually is working (hopefully), but just hadn't been compiled for some reason
      - RESOLVED (maybe) - HANNAH 2:20PM 04/12/14
-* Fix issue with stations not being able to be killed with {endSim, Sender}, so that we don't have to call exit for stations and passengers in main (maybe)
-* Change In and Out in PlatformIn/Out and PassengerListIn/Out to Ash and Ale respectively

Note for Raewyn: Passengers should never receive a notification for a train
going in the wrong direction. Edit your cases/messages?
